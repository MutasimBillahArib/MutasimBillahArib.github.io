# **About Me**

Hey, I'm **Arib!** :wave:<br>

I'm passionate about machine learning, data science, and technologyâ€”driven by a lifelong curiosity about how things work. I believe in building interpretable, deployable models grounded in clean code, reproducibility, and real-world utility. If it can't be explained or used, it's not done.

I advocate for open knowledge, and free and open-source software as cornerstones of a fair digital future. Beyond code, I explore ideas in philosophy, freedom, and sustainability, seeing both tech and life as continuous learning journeys.
