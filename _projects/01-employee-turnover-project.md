description: This Streamlit app predicts employee attrition risk using a trained Random Forest model, helping HR identify at-risk employees and implement proactive retention strategies. Users input employee data—such as tenure, workload, and performance—and instantly receive a risk score, key drivers of attrition, and actionable recommendations. Built on insights from real employee data, the app also features "what-if" scenario analysis and model transparency through feature importance, making advanced analytics accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
