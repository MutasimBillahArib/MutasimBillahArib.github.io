description: In this Machine Learning with Python Certification, we used the TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks and explored more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning. We also dived deep into neural networks, and learned the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work.
